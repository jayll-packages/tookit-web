# **App Name**: PromptForge

## Core Features:

- Prompt Template Editor: A text input area where users can create and edit prompt templates using Jinja-like syntax (e.g., `your task is {{task}}; your target is {{target}}`).
- Variable List Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing a list of variables that can be used in the prompt template.
- Prompt Rendering: Dynamically render the completed prompt by replacing the variables in the template with user-defined values.
- Copy to Clipboard: A button to easily copy the rendered prompt to the user's clipboard.
- Import/Export: Functionality to export the prompt templates and variables to JSON files and import them back into the tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light pastel blue (#B0E2FF) for a calm and soft interface, reflecting the Neumorphism style.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to create a subtle contrast and enhance the embossed effect.
- Accent color: Slightly darker pastel blue (#A0D2EB) used sparingly for interactive elements, maintaining low contrast.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font suitable for both headings and body text, for readability and a modern feel.
- Emphasize rounded corners and soft shadows for all elements, aligning with Neumorphism principles.
- Use smooth, subtle press/release animations for buttons and interactive elements to provide tactile feedback without hard lines.
- Use minimalist, monochromatic icons that fit the Neumorphism aesthetic. Ensure icons have subtle depth using inner and outer shadows.
